SpreeYoutubeEmbed
=================

Spree extension to add Youtube videos to products with similar integration as images. WARNING: An override of JavaScript behavior on images Spree::Products#show will stop images from changing on mouse hover, need to do a refactoring on "app/assets/javascrips/frontend/products.js.coffee" or some adjustment on "app/assets/javascrips/frontend/spree_youtube_embed.js" 

TODOS:

- Better Commenting (Initial Release)
- Rules for others video hosting ie.: Vimeo
- CoffeeScript optimization to restore onmouseenter and onmouseleave behavior to images
- CSS optimization

Installation

```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_youtube_embed/factories'
